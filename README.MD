# Grokking Algorithms!

This repository is dedicated to note-taking and experimentation related to the book "Grokking Algorithms" by Aditya Bhargava. Here, you can find code snippets, experiments, and notes on various topics covered in the book, including algorithms, data structures, and more.

The goal of this repository is to provide a space for me to deepen my understanding of the concepts covered in the book, and to practice implementing them on my own.
